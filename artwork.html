                <br>
                In Shakespeare's <i>"A Midsummer Night's Dream"</i> there is the idea of "Artificial Love". <br>
                In the play this is expressed through the manipulation of emotions by magic, but "Fake Love" exists in the real world too, without the use of any magic. <br>
                Demetrius, originally in love with Hermia, is enchanted and suddenly adores Helena: <br>
                "O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!" (Act II, Scene II). <br>
                Similarly, Lysander, under the same spell, abandons Hermia, declaring: <br>
                "Not Hermia but Helena I love" (Act II, Scene II). <br>
                The love potion in the play distorts the true emotions by replacing them with false ideas of love for another. <br>
                This isn't really too different from situations that happen in the real world. 
                For example, where a couple in a closed relationship have one person who becomes intrigued by another. <i>(Often through carnal desire.)</i> <br>
                Which person that they loved was the "True Love"? Did they really ever even love anyone in the first place? <br>
                The clause on the bottom-right of this marriage certificate reflects this idea of an "Artificial Love". <br>
                The idea is that True Love becomes voided upon the corruption of external forces, rather than remaining pure as a genuine emotional connection.
